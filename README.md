### Hi there 👋

<!--
**DIHAC/DIHAC** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
This project is based on C++ and MIRACL to realize the paper “Double Issuer-Hiding Attribute-based Credentials from Tag-based Aggregatable Mercurial Signatures”.
If you want to use this project, first download and compile MIRACL (https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL). //test make ./test
